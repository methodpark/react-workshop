# Assignment 5: Redux Toolkit

In this assignment, we'll add the connection between React and Redux.

## 5.1 Refactor to Redux Toolkit

You may have noticed that you had to write quite some boilerplate code in
the previous assignment. We'll clean that up now by introducing *Redux Toolkit*!

Use the `createSlice` API to create all those action creators, initial state,
and the reducer at once.

Don't forget to add a `default export` of the slice's reducer, and named
`export`s for the actions and selectors.

The functionality should not change. Use your existing unit tests to verify
this. You probably will need to adapt the test code a bit, but that should be
limited to the naming of the exports. The test logic will stay the same.

## 5.2 Connect React and Redux

To actually make use of the fine Redux state handling logic, we need to connect
it to our React app.

Use *React Toolkit's* `configureStore` to set up the Redux store, and make it
available to the React app via a `<Provider>`.

After that, adapt your component(s) to use the Redux state handling. The *hooks*
`useDispatch` and `useSelector` from the package `react-redux` will help you
with that.

## *BONUS ASSIGNMENT*

Add an indicator that shows the quality of temperature and humidity.

This should be represented by a smiley face and an appropriate label, as shown below.

### Humidity

| Range                       | Representation
|-----------------------------|----------------
| humidity < 40%              | ðŸ˜Ÿ *dry*
| 40% < humidity < 60%        | ðŸ˜€ *normal*
| humidity â‰¥ 60%              | ðŸ˜Ÿ *moist*

### Temperature

| Range                       | Representation
|-----------------------------|----------------
| temperature < 17Â° C         | ðŸ˜Ÿ *cold*
| 17Â° C < temperature < 25Â° C | ðŸ˜€ *normal*
| temperature â‰¥ 25Â° C         | ðŸ˜Ÿ *hot*
